    The program reads a development set of hand-annotated texts in
    TEI XML format and collects all examples for each error category.

    A way to configure this program is to clone the iceErrorCorpus
    repository (from the above path) into a separate directory, and
    then place a symlink to it to the /eval directory. For example:

    $ cd github
    $ git clone https://github.com/antonkarl/iceErrorCorpus
    $ cd GreynirCorrect/eval
    $ ln -s ../../iceErrorCorpus/ .
