About the Greynir project
-------------------------

**GreynirCorrect** is a part of the **Greynir** project, produced by
Miðeind ehf. of Reykjavík, Iceland.
It is a free open source software initiative,
started in mid-2015 by its original author, Vilhjálmur Þorsteinsson.
Its aim is to produce an **industrial-strength Natural Language**
**Processing toolset for Icelandic**, with the hope of supporting the
language on the digital front in times of rapid advances in language
technology; changes that may leave low-resource languages at a
disadvantage unless explicit action is taken to strengthen their position.
